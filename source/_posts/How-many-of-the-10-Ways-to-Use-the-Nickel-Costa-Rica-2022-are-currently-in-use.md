#  What was the motivation behind creating the 10 Ways to Use the Nickel Costa Rica 2022?

Nickel was first discovered in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt. He named the mineral after the Greek “nickel”, meaning victory, because its discovery came shortly after Sweden’s military victories over Russia. In 1922, the U.S. Mint began producing coins from nickel-copper alloy. In 1943, during World War II, the U.S. Mint changed the composition of the five-cent coin to almost pure nickel, because nickel was in short supply as a result of being used in armor and other military hardware.
